# Infrastructure

<img src="img/infrastructure.svg" style="height: 200px">

???
Let's start with infrastructure.

When I say "infrastructure" I mean everything that lives on the physical layer:

# Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

# Governments

???
Most of the infrastructure that we use to go online is managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs),

and in many cases, regulated by a government authority.

## Censorship - Surveillance

???
Both of them may engage in censorship, and surveillance.

Censorship at the infrastructure level is mostly dictated and carried out by government agencies.

Certain governments have opted for shutting down internet access altogether in times of civil unrest.

# Services

<img src="img/services.svg" style="height:200px">

???
Let's move on to services.

When I say "services, " I mean everything that lives on the digital layer:

---

class: center, middle

## Services

<img src="img/services.svg" style="height: 50px">

## Centralization - Censorship - Surveillance


???
Many of these services are controlled by centralized systems

that may also engage in censorship and surveillance practices.

https://techcrunch.com/2017/07/28/aws-wont-be-ceding-its-massive-market-share-lead-anytime-soon/ 
</div>

???
Why is centralization a bad thing?

Google, Facebook, and Amazon have come to dominate the services that support the internet.

Google processes more than 5 billion queries per day.

Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly active users.

Amazon controls over one third of all cloud infrastructure services.

Market dominance has turned these companies into gatekeepers of information,

so we have to trust them to use their power fairly and responsibly...but they don't.

In fact, all of them have huge financial incentives to not only monitor our behaviour,

but also manipulate it whenever possible.

</div>

???
Think about the power they yield when it comes to content moderation and censorship- 

we are relying on businesses to dictate when content should

and should not be blocked.

This power has been noticed by governments, and they have started to get more involved in the

conversation regarding online content.

This week, the Canadian federal government announced a digital charter that aims to

regulate online platforms when it comes to trust, privacy, and hate speech.

We'll see how this develops.

also share it with governments agencies and marketing firms.

Today's Networks

# Community

<img src="img/community.svg" style="height: 200px">

???
Lastly, a network needs a community: without people using it,

technology has no purpose!

---

class: center

## Community

<img src="img/community.svg" style="height: 50px">

class: center, middle

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/community.svg" style="height: 40px">
<div>Today's Communities</div>
</div>

## Users

### Group Members
### Followers
### Subscribers
### Moderators

???
How do we join an online communities, and how do we communicate today?

We visit a website for a popular platform and sign their terms of service,

then we go ahead and form or join facebook or whatsapp groups.

We become redditors, Twitter followers or Youtube subscribers.

It doesn't matter the platform, we turn into a monetization target 

for tech giant A, B, or C.

---

class: middle, center

# Inspiration

???
So, we have identified some issues. What can we do about them?

How can we do better than today's networks?

---

class: center, middle

### Inspiration

## Concepts for a Better Web

### > Open Source

### > Peer-to-Peer

### > Mesh Networks

---

class: center

# <i class="fab fa-osi"></i> Open Source


### A product or service includes permission to use its source code, design documents, or data

#### Examples: 

### Linux OS

### Toronto Mesh

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.kernel.org/ </br>
https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/governance
</div>

???
The first one is the concept of open source.

Open source means the data for a given product or service is available for study, analysis, or even modification.

This can apply to just about any area- software, hardware, or even governance.

One example is the governance documents that Toronto Mesh makes public through Github. 

---

class: center

# <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

### Members work and communicate with one another without a central authority

#### Examples:

### BitTorrent

### RideAustin

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.rideaustin.com/ </br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent
</div>

???
The next term is **peer-to-peer**.

In a peer-to-peer system, members of a group or network can communicate with one another,

instead of relying on a centralized service.

One example is RideAustin, a ride-sharing co-op that links riders directly to vehicle operators.

---

class: center

# <img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 50px"> Mesh Networks

### Nodes connect to as many other nodes as possible, and cooperate with one another to efficiently transmit data back and forth.

#### Examples:

## Guifi.net
## Freifunk

<div class="img-right">
<img src="img/guifi-map.png" style="width: 320px;">
</div>

<div class="bottom-url">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking
</div>

???
Last is the concept of a Mesh Network.

Members of a mesh network, also called nodes, connect to as many other nodes as possible,

and cooperate with one another to efficiently transmit data back and forth.

Let's take a look at a couple of internet access models to see how this idea can work in practice.

---

class: center, isp-monopoly

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Mesh Networks</p>
</div>

### Access model: ISP <> Content

???
This is an over-simplified version of how we access the internet today. 

We connect to an ISP, and in turn they connect us to an content provider.

What would it look like with a mesh network?

---

class: center, isp-mesh

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Mesh Networks</p>
</div>

### Access model: Mesh <> ISP <> Content

???
This is just one option:

Using a mesh network, only a few computers require an internet connection,

and all of its members can still access content.

With these ideas in mind, let's go over some infrastructure ideas.

---

class: center, middle

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/infrastructure.svg" style="height: 40px">
<div>Infrastructure Inspiration</div>
</div>

## Ownership Models

???
Communities are exploring different ownership models for infrastructure.

--

### > Community Networks 
### > Public Sector

???
Some are leveraging mesh technologies to build networks based on their needs, 

while others are pushing local governments to provide affordable internet access.

---

class: center

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/infrastructure.svg" style="height: 40px">

### Community Networks

<div class=img-dual>
<img class="large-image" src="img/freifunk.png">

</div>

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.nycmesh.net/map </br>
https://freifunk.net/en/how-to-join/find-your-nearest-community/
</div>

???
Two examples of community networks are Freifunk and NYCMesh.

Freifunk is a non-commercial grassroots initiative to support free computer networks in Germany.

NYCMesh is a non-profit project of the Internet Society.

Having control of a network at the community level lowers the incentive

for discriminating against network traffic,

and it makes censorship and surveillance harder to implement.

## > Decentralized Services
## > Peer-to-peer Protocols

???
That covers infrastructure, how about services?

I will talk about a handful of open source projects that aim to deliver an alternative

to centralized platforms- I will refer to them as decentralized services and 

peer-to-peer protocols.

## Peer-to-Peer **Protocols**

### **Protocol**: A system of rules that allows entities in a communications system to transmit information

### > Scuttlebutt
### > Dat

???
I'll talk about a couple of peer-to-peer protocols next: Scuttlebutt and Dat

A protocol is just a set of rules that computers in a network use

to communicate with one another.

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/services.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Services Inspiration</p>
</div>

### Access model: Mesh <> ISP <> Content

???
Think about how we publish and access content on social networks.

Let's go back to our earlier model for content access

Imagine a friend of yours posts a photo on facebook.

Facebook will add that post to your feed, and you'll see it next time you log in.

Can we think of another way to share our data?


---

class: center, mesh-content

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/services.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Services Inspiration</p>
</div>

### Access model: Mesh + P2P Content

???
Using peer-to-peer protocols, we are able to do away with centralized services

and share content directly with one another.

One such protocol is called Scuttlebutt.

---

## A secure gossip platform

Scuttlebutt is a protocol for secure communications,

on top of which different kinds of applications can be built.

# Scuttlebutt

<img src="img/hermies-gift.gif" width="10%">

### Offline-friendly

### No central server

### No central database

???
Applications that work well offline and that no one person can control

Scuttlebutt clients connect to their peers to exchange information- 

this means I hold my friends' data and they hold mine.

Because there are no central servers, 

it is much harder to collect data on a massive scale

There is no "company" for a tech giant to buy, and no single database

for governments to data mine.

## > Software

### Patch* on desktop
### Manyverse on mobile

## > Peers (+ Pubs)

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/applications.html </br>
</div>

???
This is a fully peer-to-peer system, so there is no need for a server.

You can istall patchwork, patchbay, or patchfoo on your computer,

or manyverse on your phone.

But the requirements to connect with another peer also differs.

If I want to start "following" friends, I have two options:

1. Open the client software while we are on the same network (wired or wireless) so I can see them.

2. Get an invite to join a "Pub" they are connected to. A Pub is a server that allows peers

to connect to each other.

The computer or phone that you use for Scuttlebutt will hold your identity,

your data, and your friends' data, so the software has been designed to

only download the data for peers up to three hops away from you.

## What does your ideal network look like?


???
So far we have covered the shortcomings of today's networks,

as well as several projects groups are working on to improve things.

Now, how do you see your communities evolving?

We have some paper and markers to help us imagine what a network

can look like if it is built for our community first and foremost.
