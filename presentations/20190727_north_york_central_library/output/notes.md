# Presentation Debrief

## Summary

- The presentation introduced attendees to peer-to-peer networks and Toronto Mesh, and ended with a guided tour of Patchwork and IPFS Desktop.

## Location

- This talk took place at North York Central Library, and was hosted by their Digital Innovation Hub.

## Setup

- The library made 13 laptops available to attendees.
- All machines had Patchwork and IPFS Desktop installed prior to the presentation.

## Presentation

- 20 people showed up (all adults), and they were all very attentive during the presentation.
- Early in the slide deck I asked how many people knew what BitTorrent was through a show of hands, and just about everyone raised their hands.
- For the hands-on portion, I ran a guided tour of Patchwork and IPFS.

### Patchwork Demo Tasks

- Download and install (for people not using library-issued laptops)
- Create up a Scuttlebutt ID
- Discover local peers through the wireless network
  - We could not find local peers when we were connected to the TPL wireless network. I brought one Raspberry Pi node and asked everyone to connect to its access point.  It struggled a bit with all the traffic, but everyone's messages went through eventually.
- Publish messages
- Reply to messages

### IPFS Desktop Tasks

- Donwload and install (for people not using library-issued laptops)
- Connect to the Raspberry Pi access point
- Copy hash
  - I published the presentation files to IPFS and posted the hash on Patchwork so everyone could copy and paste it on their machines.
- Download files and view them locally.
  - View presentation locally on a browser. The file transfers still struggles with all the traffic, but everyone was  able to view the files I shared.
- Some attendees posted files of their own as well.

### Follow-up

- The library would like to have us over again, and they would be open to hosting a course as well (we could aim for fall/winter of 2020 to prepare a curriculum together).
