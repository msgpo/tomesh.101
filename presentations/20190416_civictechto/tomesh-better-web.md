# Toronto Mesh

???
Toronto Mesh is a group of volunteers that was started at CivicTechTO in early 2016.

Our work includes, among other things, building hardware and software solutions for networking applications,

and organizing outreach activities that focus on technical literacy.

# Agenda

### Goal: Share ideas for building a better Web

???
Today, I will talk about some ways in which we can build a better Web together.

--

## 1. The Web Today: Issues üëé

## 2. The Web Tomorrow: Fixes üëç

## 3. Toronto Mesh

## 4. Toronto Mesh and You

???
First, I will talk about some of the challenges the Internet is facing today.

Then, I will discuss some of the solutions being explored to address them,

and how our work relates to them.

Finally, I will go over some of the ways in which you can contribute.

--

- We will only scratch the surface

???
I will only cover topics from a very high level,

so I apologize if I gloss over some things.

We can discuss plenty afterwards.

The Web Today

# Infrastructure

<img src="img/infrastructure.svg">

Let's start with infrastructure.

When I say "infrastructure" I mean everything that lives on the physical layer:

Most of the infrastructure that we use to go online is managed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs),

and in many cases, regulated by a government authority.

Censorship is another kind of filtering.

Censorship at the infrastructure level is mostly dictated and carried out by government agencies.

This is a flowchart the Chinese government uses to assess online content.

Certain governments have opted for shutting down internet access altogether in times of civil unrest.

## Centralization - Censorship - Surveillance

Many of these services are controlled by centralized systems

that may also engage in censorship and surveillance practices.

</div>

???
Regarding centralization-

Google, Facebook, and Amazon have come to dominate the services that support the internet.

Market dominance has turned these companies into gatekeepers of information,

so we have to trust them to use their power fairly and responsibly.

<!-- Google processes more than 5 billion queries per day.

Facebook has more than 2 billion monthly active users.

Amazon controls over one third of all cloud infrastructure services. -->

<div class="slide-label">

<h1><strong>Community</strong></h1>
</div>


???
Before we can begin doing any work on hardware or software,

we must recognize that technology has no purpose without the people using it.

The key part to building a better web is our Community!

It's the users who must demand and bring about change.

So, how do we prepare our community for tomorrow's web?

---

class: center, middle

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/community.svg" style="height: 40px">
<div>The Web Tomorrow: Community</div>
</div>

## 1. Awareness

This is us, here and now!

???
First off, we need people to become aware of the issues we have seen.

This may be as simple as finding out about how online services or governments routinely misuse our data.

--

## 2. Education

???
Developing literacy is the next step-

Maybe you want to become familiar with government policy,

build some networking know-how,

or research the business model of your favourite social network.

--

## 3. Engagement

???
Finally, a community can begin working on changes-

they may opt for adopting less intrusive services,

pushing for adequate legislation, or even building a network!

### The Web Tomorrow

<h2>Community Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è‚úî</h2>

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/services.svg" style="height: 40px">
<h1>Services</h1>
</div>

???
In order to better understand some of the technologies around infrastructure and services,

there are three terms I need to explain.

---

class: center

The Web Tomorrow: Prerequisites

# <i class="fab fa-osi"></i> Open Source


### A product or service includes permission to use its source code, design documents, or data

#### Examples: 

### Linux OS

### Toronto Mesh

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.kernel.org/ </br>
https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/governance
</div>

???
The first one is the concept of open source.

Open source means the data for a given product or service is available for study, analysis, or even modification.

This can apply to just about any area- software, hardware, or even governance.

One example is the Toronto Mesh governance documents that we make public through Github. 

---

class: center

The Web Tomorrow: Prerequisites

# <i class="fas fa-users"></i> Peer-to-Peer (P2P)

### Members work and communicate with one another without a central authority

#### Examples:

### BitTorrent

### RideAustin

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.rideaustin.com/ </br>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent
</div>

???
The next term is **peer-to-peer**.

In a peer-to-peer system, members of a group or network can communicate with one another,

instead of relying on a centralized service.

One example is RideAustin, a ride-sharing service that links riders directly to vehicle operators.

---

class: center

The Web Tomorrow: Prerequisites

# <img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 50px"> Mesh Network

### Nodes connect to as many other nodes as possible, and cooperate with one another to efficiently transmit data back and forth.

#### Examples:

## Guifi.net
## Freifunk

<div class="img-right">
<img src="img/guifi-map.png" style="width: 320px;">
</div>

<div class="bottom-url">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking
</div>

???
Last is the concept of a Mesh Network.

Members of a mesh network, also called nodes, connect to as many other nodes as possible,

and cooperate with one another to efficiently transmit data back and forth.

Let's take a look at a couple of internet access models to see how this idea can work in practice.

---

class: center

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Tomorrow's Web: Mesh Networks</p>
</div>

### Access model: ISP <> Content

<img class="medium-image" src="img/data-isp-monopoly.svg">

???
This is an over-simplified version of how we access the internet today. 

We connect to an ISP, and in turn they allow us to pull content from a service provider.

What would it look like with a mesh network?

---

class: center

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/mesh-network.svg" style="height: 40px">
<p>Tomorrow's Web: Mesh Networks</p>
</div>

### Access model: Mesh <> ISP <> Content

<img class="medium-image" src="img/data-centralized.svg">

???
This is just one option. Using a mesh network, only a few computers need to have internet access,

and all of its members can still access content.

With these ideas in mind, let's talk about infrastructure in tomorrow's web.

---

class: center, middle

<div class="slide-label">
<img src="img/infrastructure.svg" style="height: 40px">
<div>The Web Tomorrow: Infrastructure</div>
</div>

## Ownership Models

???
Communities are exploring different ownership models for infrastructure.

--

### Community Networks 

### Public Sector

???
Some are leveraging mesh technologies to build networks based on their needs, 

while others are pushing local governments to provide affordable internet access.

---

</div>

<div class="bottom-url">
https://www.nycmesh.net/map </br>
https://freifunk.net/en/how-to-join/find-your-nearest-community/
</div>

???
Two examples of community networks are Freifunk and NYCMesh.

Freifunk is a non-commercial grassroots initiative to support free computer networks in Germany.

NYCMesh is a non-profit project of the New York chapter of the Internet Society (ISOC-NY).

Having control of a network at the community level lowers the incentive for discriminating against network traffic,

and it makes censorship and surveillance harder to implement.

### **Protocol**: A system of rules that allows entities in a communications system to transmit information

???
Now, what about services? We will stop talking about services now, and instead

focus on open source peer-to-peer protocols.

A protocol is just a set of rules that computers in a network use to communicate with one another.

Think about how we publish and access content on social networks.

Facebook will add that post to my feed, and I'll see it next time I log in.

There is no "company" for a tech giant to buy, and no single database for governments to data mine.

peer-to-peer applications, and how to organize community networks.

We have worked very hard to make the workshop materials accessible for any person or group

looking to use it in their community.

At this stage, we don't have a permanent wireless link between any two nodes,

so our mesh is linked through the internet. 

The site on the right shows all the nodes connected to the Toronto Mesh at any given time.

Maybe you want to host a mesh node at your home or office to help us

test and grow the network. If we're lucky, you will be within range of an existing node.

--

### Tech Development

???
If you're into the technical stuff, we have lots of ideas to implement

on both hardware and software.

--

### Design

???
We also have a healthy backlog of design-related tasks, from branding and website design

to stickers and educational materials.

I have brought a couple of nodes with me today- if anyone wants to play with them,

discuss peer-to-peer systems or ask about contributing to Toronto Mesh, I will be around.

I will leave you with the words of Sir Tim Berners Lee on the 30th aniversary of the Web last month.

The web is for anyone and collectively we hold the power to change it.

It won't be easy.

But if we dream a little and work a lot,

we can get the web we want.
