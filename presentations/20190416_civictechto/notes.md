# Toronto Mesh Presentation at Civic Tech Toronto

## Goals
- Introduce the audience to Toronto Mesh, our vision, our team, and our work.
- Invite people to join our efforts on tech literacy and wireless link deployments.
- Generate discussion about how our infrastructure and applicatons can be improved upon.

Time limit: 10 minutes + 10 minutes of Q&A

## Structure

- One minute to introduce myself and the group
- Three minutes to cover shortcomings on the Internet as we know it- infra + applications
- Four minutes to cover alternatives: other success stories (guifi + freifunk)
- Two minutes to display the work we have done so far and calls for action

## Format

- Use benhylau's 34c3 slidedeck as a starting point
- Reveal / remark slide deck
- Images + diagrams first, keep text to a minimum
- Test demoing Beaker, Patchwork, and IPFS

### Introduction (1 minute)

Hello, my name is Dante. I am a Mechanical Engineer by trade, and in my spare time I enjoy reading and working on software.  My areas of interest include issues surrounding online access, privacy and surveillance. I am currently the organizing lead for Toronto Mesh.

Toronto Mesh is a decentralized group of volunteers that was started at CivicTechTO in early 2016. Our mission is to help communities create better networks with open source and peer-to-peer technologies that promote digital literacy and privacy. I will go over each of these terms shortly.

I am here to talk to you about some of the challenges that our networks are facing from both the infrastructure and applications points of view, what Toronto Mesh is doing to improve upon them, and how you can contribute to these efforts.

### Waiver

I should note that all of the topics I will touch upon represent the tip of the iceberg in their respective context, and due to time restrictions I will only mention these from a high level.

### The Problem(s)

#### Infrastructure

Much of the infrastructure that we use to go online -be it fibre, cable, DSL or mobile- is managed by Internet service providers (ISPs) that may filter, snoop on, and record data transfers.  

This same infrastructure is in many cases prone to disruptions due to natural disasters and malicious interference.

Governments around the world block sites and services that would empower people with communication and education tools, as well as access to non-official sources of information.
I will go over a few specific examples that illustrate these challenges.

### Filtering: throttling

Bandwidth Throttling: the intentional slowing or speeding of an internet service by an ISP. 

In 2014, Netflix was forced to cut a deal with Comcast (one of the largest ISPs in the US) in order to keep their content flowing freely.

In Canada, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC for short) has issued rules to support Net Neutrality principles which were further strengthened in 2017, but regulatory capture and lobbying efforts by ISPs require constant vigilance, as demonstrated in last year's comments from the CRTC chair.

### Filtering: censorship

Regarding censorship, China has a small army of people monitoring internet activity at all times. Much like Egypt, the government forces all online traffic through a mere three central routing systems. This makes it easy for censors to sift through all data entering and leaving the country.

Bell has claimed that Canada is a safe haven for internet pirates and wants a website blacklist implemented by the CRTC.

### Privacy / Surveillance

Surveillance programs can be put in place for profit or social control, and the two are not always decoupled from one another.

In 2017, the US repealed rules that would have required ISPs to get customer permission to collect, use and sell information about their online habits.

State-sponsored surveillance programs routinely collect internet, telephone, and location records of people across the world.

Just over two years ago, I heard the news that the Federal Communications Commission in the U.S. was planning on repealing Net Neutrality protections (the principle that Internet Service Providers treat all data on the Internet the same, and not discriminate). I figured Canada would follow shortly, so I searched for groups in the GTA that could be working on alternatives to the ISP offerings, and I found Toronto Mesh right away. I showed up to one o




The US Congress has now  introduced the "Save the Internet Act is now working on rolling back Net Neutrality

Another alternative is pushing local governments to build and maintain infrastructure- 

One example is the Electric Power Board of Chattanooga in Tennessee.

In 2010, the EPB became the first company in the US to deliver 1GB/s Internet.
