## Meshing

* [**CJDNS**](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) - A layer 3 mesh networking protocol and application created by Caleb James DeLisle. CJDNS features encrypted connections, IPV6 addressing, and distributed routing. We use it currently in our software as a way to mesh devices and form networks.
* [**Althea**](https://altheamesh.com) - A mesh networking system that allows routers to pay each other for bandwidth, creating an "incentivized mesh". It is not currently in use by tomesh, although it is something we may deploy in the future.
